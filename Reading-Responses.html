        <p>Reading 1 Questions: 
            Question 1: Do you think we are relying too heavily on technology and the internet when it comes to education/sharing of work?

            Question 2: What are some pros and cons of the accessibility of work on the internet? If we continue to publish our work on the internet, how will things change?</p>

        <p>Reading 2 Questions: 
            Do you think the 90s web design aesthetic Olia Lialina discussed in her 2005 article has continued to be relevant today?
