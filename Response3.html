        <h3>
            Do you value the idea of a “professional” style web or that of the “amateur” design perspective more?
        </h3>
        
        <p> I do think it is important to have the skills to design a more "professional" style of web design, but I also think it is just as important for an artist or designer to influence their work with their own personal style. Especially now, I am noticing more and more designers use their own style to display information on the web. Personally, I would like to have a firm grasp on the in's and out's of more professional style of web design while I'm learning about web design. Once I learn all of the tools I would not want to be completely limited by strict rules of "professional" design. Ultimately, I value the idea of the "amature" web design perspective more because of the freedom it allows the designer has.
