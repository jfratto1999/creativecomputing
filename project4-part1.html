	<h3>Project 4, Part 1</h3>
	<h5>Juliette Fratto</h5>

	<p>It takes me about thirty minutes to get to school from my apartment in Alphabet City - sometimes twenty-five if I’m rushing and ten to fifteen if I decided to Citibike that day. I live on East 6th Street in between avenues B and C - but closer to Avenue C. So, when I step out of my apartment I immediately turn right in the direction of Avenue B. I go past an elementary school, past my friend Greg’s apartment, past one of my favorite coffee shops. I walk about five blocks until I reach Cooper Square. This is where I start to head upwards. I cut through Cooper Square, passing up Cooper Union in the process. Once I see the green sign for East 8th Street, I turn left and continue heading westward. This is one of the busier parts of my commute. The East Village and Alphabet City are essentially a dead zone when it comes to public transportation. The nearest subway station is by Cooper Square, so it’s already significantly busier no matter what time of day it is. I walk westward on East 8th Street until I reach 5th Avenue. If I look towards my left I can see the big arch in Washington Square Park and the Freedom Tower. If I look towards my right I can see the Empire State Building. At this point, I’m now on the West side. I turn right and head upwards towards the Empire State Building until I reach West 13th Street. Whichever class I have that day determines which side of the street I walk on. If I am in the Parsons Building (2 West 13th Street), I will walk on the left side. If I am in the UC, I will walk on the right side. Once I reach whichever building, I head in and if I’m lazy, I will take the elevator to my classroom. </p>
